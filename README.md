Free to use, in-development basebuilder plugin for Counter Strike 2. Requires CS2MenuManager by Schwarper. Uses snippets of code taken from CSS oficial discord (yet to be credited, they will be once the plugin is nearing completion) Made for my personal usage and as a challenge involving as much stuff as possible.

Plugin is 1/4 complete ish. What's done? >

Data bases with Dapper and SQLite
Levels / Resets / Upgrades / Human & Zombie classes
Moving blocks (Along with claiming, rotating and painting)
User customization (Preferences in color, and preferences for weapons yet to be added).
Basebuilder logic (preparation time, building time, no warmups, etc [although the cfg is bugged at the moment])
Special modes (realistic round, survivor round, nemesis round) THEY STILL HAVE TO BE TWEAKED!!
Is it playable already?

No, many critical bugs are to be fixed yet!. Once it is playable, it will be mentioned on the top of the file. Remember playable != complete.
Can i use it for my server?

Absolutely, you're free to use it as you please.
